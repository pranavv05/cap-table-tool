## üí∞ Financial Assumptions & Methodologies

### 1. Valuation Framework
- **Pre-Money Valuation**: Used as the basis for calculating ownership percentages
- **Post-Money Calculation**: Pre-money + Investment Amount = Post-money valuation
- **Option Pool Impact**: Option pool can be created pre or post-money based on configuration

### 2. Equity Distribution
- **Vesting Schedules**: Standard 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
- **Early Exercise**: Support for 83(b) election tracking
- **Exercise Windows**: Configurable periods for option exercise after termination

### 3. Funding Instruments
#### SAFE Notes
- **Valuation Cap**: Maximum valuation used for conversion
- **Discount Rate**: Applied to the price per share in next round
- **MFN Clause**: Most Favored Nation provision support
- **Pro Rata Rights**: Option to maintain ownership percentage

#### Convertible Notes
- **Interest Rate**: Simple interest accrual until conversion
- **Maturity Date**: Automatic conversion at maturity if not triggered earlier
- **Qualified Financing**: Conversion triggers at specified funding thresholds

### 4. Dilution Protection
- **Weighted Average**: Broad-based and narrow-based calculations
- **Full Ratchet**: Protection against down rounds
- **Pay-to-Play**: Provisions requiring participation to maintain anti-dilution rights

### 5. Liquidation Preferences
- **Multiple Preferences**: Support for 1x, 2x, etc.
- **Participation**: With and without caps
- **Seniority**: Multiple series with different priority levels
- **Deemed Liquidation Events**: M&A, asset sales, and other trigger events

### 6. Tax Considerations
- **409A Valuations**: Tracking of fair market value
- **Exercise Timing**: Impact on tax treatment
- **Early Exercise**: 83(b) election implications

### 7. Reporting & Compliance
- **Cap Table Reports**: Detailed ownership breakdowns
- **409A Documentation**: Historical valuation tracking
- **Board Approvals**: Documentation of major transactions

### 8. Assumption Validation
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Testing key assumptions
- **Scenario Modeling**: Best/worst case projections
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all calculations

- Pro-rata rights management

### 3. Dilution and Conversion
- Automatic dilution calculations for new funding rounds
- Anti-dilution provisions (weighted average)
- Convertible note conversion at qualified financing events
- Interest accrual on convertible instruments

### 4. Tax and Compliance
- 409A valuation tracking
- FMV calculations for stock options
- Tax reporting exports (PDF/Excel)
- Audit trail of all cap table changes

## üîÑ Application Workflow

### User Authentication & Onboarding
